# About the Lab

The Interdisciplinary Livestock Microbiome Research Lab focuses on understanding how microbial communities interact with livestock hosts.

We combine microbiome sequencing, bioinformatics, and systems biology to uncover the dynamics of gut and environmental microbiota in cattle, swine, and poultry.
